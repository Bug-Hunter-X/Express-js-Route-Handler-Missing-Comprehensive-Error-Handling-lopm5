# Express.js Route Handler Missing Comprehensive Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that lacks detailed error responses, while `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description

The original route handler attempts to find a user based on the ID passed in the URL parameter. However, it does not properly handle cases where the provided ID is invalid (e.g., not a number, or no user exists with that ID).  This lack of handling can lead to unexpected behavior and makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution includes improved error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs and non-existent users.  It provides more informative error messages to the client (e.g., 400 for bad request, 404 for not found), which greatly aids in identifying and fixing issues.
